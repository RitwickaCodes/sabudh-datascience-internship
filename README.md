# Sabudh Foundation Data Science Internship

## Overview

This repository contains the solutions to the weekly Python programming challenges assigned during my Data Science internship at Sabudh Foundation. The internship started in July 2024.

## Structure

The repository is organized into folders for each week under the `python-coding-challenge` directory. Each folder contains the solutions to the respective week's challenges.

### Folder and File Descriptions

- **`python-coding-challenge/`**: Contains the coding challenges for the internship.
  - **`week-1/`**: The folder for the first week's coding challenges.
    - **`problem_1.py`**: Solution to the first problem.
    - **`problem_2.py`**: Solution to the second problem.
    - **`problem_3.py`**: Solution to the third problem.
    - **`problem_4.py`**: Solution to the fourth problem.
    - **`problem_5.py`**: Solution to the fifth problem.
    - **`problem_6.py`**: Solution to the sixth problem.
    - **`problem_7.py`**: Solution to the seventh problem.
    - **`problem_8.py`**: Solution to the eighth problem.
    - **`problem_9.py`**: Solution to the ninth problem.
    - **`problem_10.py`**: Solution to the tenth problem.

## Usage

To run any of the solutions, navigate to the corresponding week's folder and execute the Python file using the command line or any Python IDE.

For example, to run the first problem of week 1:
```sh
cd python-coding-challenge/week-1
python problem_1.py
```
