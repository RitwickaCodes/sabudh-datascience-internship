# Sabudh Foundation Data Science Internship

## Overview

This repository contains the solutions to the weekly programming challenges assigned during my Data Science internship at Sabudh Foundation. The internship started in July 2024.

## Structure

The repository is organized into folders for each week under the `datascience-coding-challenge` and `python-module-coursework` directory. Each folder contains the solutions to the respective week's challenges.

### Folder and File Descriptions

- **`datascience-coding-challenge/`**: Contains the coding challenges for the internship.
  - **`week-1/`**: The folder for the first week's coding challenges.
  - **`week-2/`**: The folder for the second week's coding challenges.
- **`python-module-coursework/`**: Contains the python module coursework Jupyter notebooks for the internship.
  - **`Python-Module-Coursework-06-08-2024.ipynb`**: Notebook for the python assignments on 06-08-2024.
  - **`Python-Module-Coursework-13-08-2024.ipynb`**: Notebook for the python assignments on 13-08-2024.
    

## Usage

To run any of the solutions, navigate to the corresponding week's folder and execute the Python file using the command line or any Python IDE.

For example, to run the first problem of week 1:
```sh
cd datascience-coding-challenge/week-1
python problem_1.py
```
